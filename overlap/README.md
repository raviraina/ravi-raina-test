# OVERLAPPING LINE SEGMENTS
A python program to find overlapping line segments on the x-axis. For example: given two coordinantes (x1,x2), (x3,x4), the program will return `True` if they overlap and `False` otherwise.

## Usage

Import using: `from overlap import overlap`
Call using: `overlap(p1,p2)`, where p1 and p2 are int tuples of size 2.
